## strapdown.js.balloon.net.eu.org

This is a temporary Strapdown.js CDN using GitHub Pages.\
I have some Strapdown.js here.

Original `strapdown.js`. You replace this:

```
<script src="https://strapdownjs.com/v/0.2/strapdown.js"></script>
```

I've included the replacement URL, but this is subject to change later,\
so you should use this for temporary use.\
I'm looking for a suitable CDN,\
but you can fork or download and bundle it on the web instead.
